# Streamlit Database Entry App


## 📌 Project Overview
This Streamlit project is a simple web application that allows users to input personal details such as first name, last name, middle name, age, course, and an "about life" section. The submitted data is stored in a MySQL database with an individual entry ID, timestamp, and date of submission.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project consists of three main Python files:

- **`createdatabase.py`** – Establishes a connection to MySQL, creates the database, and defines the table structure.
- **`databaseinput.py`** – Handles the insertion of user-submitted values into the database.
- **`streamlit.py`** – The main Streamlit application that collects user inputs and submits them to the database via `databaseinput.py`.

## ✨ Features
✅ User-friendly Streamlit UI for data entry.  
✅ MySQL database integration for data storage.  
✅ Automatic recording of submission date and time.  
✅ Unique ID assigned to each entry.
